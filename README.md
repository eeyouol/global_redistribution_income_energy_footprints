# global_redistribution_income_energy_footprints
data and code for the paper Oswald et al. (2021) Global redistribution of income and household energy footprints: A computational thought experiment

1) code.py is the main script of code for the paper
2) data contains all underlying critical data necessary to reproduce analysis
3) footprint_calc.py is a function to actually compute energy footprints via power laws
4) gini.py computes the gini coefficient
